## AIOTI Testbeds Portfolio

The focus of the **Testbeds IG group of [AIOTI](aioti.eu)** is to provide a set of testbed descriptions based on a specific format and has as aim to contribute to a coordinated view on testbeds derived from content provided by AIOTI partners; the use-cases being developed; the European competitiveness domains being addressed; global perspective on the interest of partners in terms of testbeds.

The main goal of the catalogue is to act as a dissemination tool towards other AIOTI groups, and to assist in the development of coordinated efforts, e.g., use-case demonstrations, new testbed development.

This Github Pages repository serves the catalogue of AIOTI members to demonstrate the work relevant for the Urban Society needs.
