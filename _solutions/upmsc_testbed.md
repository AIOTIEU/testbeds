description: The Experience Lab of the Spaces of the Future is a 160sq space for demonstration and service testing development located within CAIT Building at UPM Montegancedo Campus (Madrid, Spain). It is composed of reconfigurable semi-open rooms, specifically conceived to test personalized service concepts and interactive spaces. At the Lab, there are different technology enablers on top of which different service concepts have been trialed: IoT platforms on edge, multiuser indoor positioning systems based on hybrid sensors, a platform to provide multidevice collaborative augmented reality experiences, systems for multimodal natural (gesture-based, voice-based) interaction, concepts of smart objects (e.g., smart windows) and technologies for command-and-control centers.
concept: Edge platforms, indoor positioning, augmented reality, gesture-based, voice-based interaction, ultra-wall interaction, multisensor tracking, personalized services
technology: IoT, artificial intelligence, microservices platforms behavior analysis algorithms, data fusion,
hardware: High resolution ultra-wall, Arduino boards, smart cameras, interaction sensors (leap motion, Kinect, etc.), HoloLens, mobile devices, TV screens, Bluetooth beacons, ultrawideband beacons, servers,
software: MQTT, Kafka, Docker, MongoDB, Python, OpenCV, others.
