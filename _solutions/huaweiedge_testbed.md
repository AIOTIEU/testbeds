description: Converged OT and IT network through TSN technology, carrying heterogeneous traffics, such as automation control, optical inspection, and video surveillance, from the field to the edge. Both the need of Time-critical control traffic and bandwidth consuming traffic can be met. Edge AI for industry using IEF framework for deployment and IEC 61499 for industry component integration.
concept: Heterogeneous traffics (Automation control, video, events) and industrial protocols (OPC UA, IEC 61499, Modbus-TCP) carried on the unified TSN network, where the delay and reliability requirements can be met by centralized auto-configuration.
technology: TSN data plane using combined Priority/Time-aware scheduling and shaping; TSN control plane integrated with network calculus algorithms; brownfield device compatibility solutions; Edge AI integrated industrial automation control.
hardware: TSN-IP switches (S67xx; S57xx); Edge computing gateway (AR502H); Any-to-ETH gateway prototype; Miniature automobile production line; Automated Optical Inspection and video surveillance cameras.
software: OPC UA supervisory control; IEC 61499 controller; TSN centralized controller; Network Calculus algorithm; Kubeedge; Mindspore (for AI)
