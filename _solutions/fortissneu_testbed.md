description: The Neuromorphic Lab showcases one use case of neuromorphic computing, namely in mobile robotics. In this use case, a Lamprey like robot is being controlled by a spiking neural network over neuromorphic hardware (the experimental Loihi chip from Intel). The robot is swimming in simulation, controlled by a network powering a series of coupled oscillators that move each joint in a coherent manner, over super low energy hardware. This demonstrator proves the potential of neuromorphic hardware in edge AI applications where energy efficiency is a key factor. Further use cases, like industrial robotic arms, low-latency event-based vision, in-car human machine interaction is investigated by the Neuromorphic Computing team.
concept: The Lamprey like robot controller has been trained with the Neural Engineering Framework (Nengo) to generate oscillations at its links that generates an efficient swimming movement. In the Lab, a recorded sequence of controller action is replayed live, enabling the user to visualize the robot while moving in real time, to navigate through the scene, observe the neural network activity.
