description: Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) has emerged with the promise to establish trust and enable new business models on autonomous systems. The exact implementation and performance of the many available DLT protocols still remains to be formally assessed. Therefore, the AIOTI DLT working group agreed to set-up a series of DLT 2.xx Testbeds for the systematic and objective evaluation of different protocols currently considered market ready.
concept: The DLT 2.xx test campaigns are executed following International Software Qualification Testing Board (ISTQB) standards and include a state of the art benchmark methodology that includes assessing the protocols both on business impact metrics (transactions-per-second, up-time, scalability) and DLT specific metrics. The integrity of the assessments is furthermore ensured by the timeline of installations being supported by the protocol suppliers and tests being executed by objective AIOTI DLT members in the presence of protocol representatives and objective observers. The outcome of the different test campaigns comes in the form of a factual report including the different DLT protocols and performance comparisons.
technology: Hyperledger, Ethereum, IOTA, Ripple and Cardano
hardware: On-Premise, Low-power devices, Edge & Cloud
software: DLT Toolbox combined with open source Software Testing tools.
