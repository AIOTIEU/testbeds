description: PIMEO AI targets the development and operational use in multiple representative environments of an artificial intelligence (AI) powered unmanned surface vehicle (USV) that is capable to perform complete suites of water quality measurements in all types of sensitive aquatic ecosystems. The resulting PIMEO AI USV will be a next-generation advanced analysis tool for studying sensitive ecosystems, identifying pollution sources, and mapping their environmental impact. It will fill an important market need for comprehensive water quality USVs, the market today being highly limited and aimed primarily at hydrology research.
