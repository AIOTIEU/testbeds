description: RECLOTHES is a DLT testbed is set to demonstrate a blockchain-based solution (built on top of Hyperledger Besu) favoring the second-hand clothes recycles in the fashion industry. Reclothes allows a company operating in the fashion sector to implement a decentralized, transparent, and secure mechanism to record information relating to business relationships among partners and people interested in selling their second-hand clothes and/or buying second-hand upcycled clothes. To promote cooperation in the circular economy process, the solution implements a “double incentive” mechanism by adopting two different fungible token implementations. Leveraging private transaction processing tools, the consortium partners can define their commercial agreements and carry out transactions in confidence, without releasing any information unauthorized third parties.
concept: A decentralized solution for second-hand clothes recycles in the fashion industry. Designed as an enterprise blockchain-based network on Hyperledger Besu; allows confidential transactions visible only among business partners while keeping a transparent public history of quantities, processes, events, and payments; encourages individuals' participation in the circular economy through a double-incentive using two ERC20 token implementations, automating payments and rewarding mechanisms; provides a public interface for people who wants to support the eco-friendly fashion industry by sending second-hand clothes and/or buying upcycled clothes.
