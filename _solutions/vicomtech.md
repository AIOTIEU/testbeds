description: In the testbed, a conveyor will move parts until they reach the working range of a Remote-Controlled Robot. A remote operator will handle the robot to pick the part and face it to a camera. Images from the camera will be transmitted by 5G technologies and the remote operator will decide if the part is valid in a full virtual immersive environment

concept: 
Web order generator and ERP to monitor production. 
 
MES, controlling the production and orchestrating the actions of the other components (conveyor, robot, camera). 
 
Conveyor, moving parts across the line and stopping when parts are detected at a predefined spot.

Digital Twin for remote quality inspection application, composed by a DT of the line and allowing the operator to control the robot and to inspect the parts. 
  
A Web quality inspection application, for use-cases not requiring the set of functionalities available with the DT application

Assest Administration Shell (AAS) based representation of the main components of the manufacturing line.
