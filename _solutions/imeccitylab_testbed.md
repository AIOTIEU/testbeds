description: The UAntwerpen/IMEC Citylab testbed is a wireless testbed deployed outdoors in the city center of Antwerp. It is ideally suited for the experimentation with- and validation of- wireless technologies, protocols and solutions under real-life operating and interference conditions. Citylab supports a wide range of wireless technologies, including IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n, IEEE 802.15.4, Bluetooth Low Energy and LoRa(WAN) but ultimately it is up to the experimenters to decide what specific radio interfaces and technologies they want to use and what software/firmware to run on the nodes. Citylab contains 30 nodes that are deployed outdoors in the streets and on roof tops in a 0.5km by 0.5km area around the city campus of the University of Antwerp and 5 indoor nodes deployed at campus middelheim.
