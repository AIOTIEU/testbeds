description: The AIOTI DLT 1.02 AIRQ DAO Testbed demonstrates the convergence of IoT and DLT into an autonomous system based on the AIOTI High Level Architecture (HLA) for data markets. Co-creation, micropayments and (smart contract) revenue-splits enable a ‘self-sustaining’ and financially autonomous IoT sensor network.
concept: The AIOTI HLA into practice. (“Co-creation & Revenue split”) Each air quality sensor integrates with the DLT network via a dedicated wallet. Local engaged citizens subscribe to notification services via micropayments. The sensor receives monthly payments, and an automated revenue split rewards the data aggregator, service providers and the AIRQ DAO foundation. If the sensor can earn its own value after two years, a smart contract orders his replacement. As such, only valuable sensors are maintained, and the network becomes (financially) self-sustainable.
technology: Converged IoT & DLT, tokenization, micropayments, and smart contracting
hardware: Solar cells, Air quality sensors, Cloud storage and virtualization
software: Ethereum vs. Cardano
