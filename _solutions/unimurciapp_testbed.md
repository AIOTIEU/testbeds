description: The Chain-enabled PP-IDM Testbed is set to demonstrate the collaboration of distributed ledger technologies DLTs and privacy-preserving technologies (PETs) for achieving trustworthy environments where users are in control of their identity and can access services with guarantees of data minimization and not being tracked by services nor identity providers.
concept: Users can obtain p-ABC credentials from a distributed infrastructure (OLYMPUS based) that secures critical points increasing the trust in all the scenarios. The IdM platform using smart contracts can unambiguously register existing identity providers and even keep track of service providers and their policies. Each service provider must communicate what information it consumes, and this is recorded in the DLT for later use. In this way, users can know in advance what data a registered service provider consumes and whether the policy it has finally demanded from them is the one it initially declared.
technology: DLT, privacy-preserving Attribute Based Credentials (p-ABC), distributed identity management. Convergence between DLT and distributed IdM for trust increase. Smart Contracts
hardware: Cloud storage, virtualization, smartphones
software: Hyperledger Fabric, OLYMPUS framework
