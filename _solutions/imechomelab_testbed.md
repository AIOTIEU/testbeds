description: The imec/UGent HomeLab is an actual standalone house offering a unique residential test environment for IoT services and smart living. A wide range of IoT technologies are deployed, and set-up flexibility to add new devices is offered by means of technical corridors, hollow floors and ceilings. The HomeLab team supports innovation at different stages from concept and co-creation with potential users, to early proof-of-concept testing in a real living environment. Supporting software tools and methods for integration, interoperability, data captation, sensor fusion are available. Application domains can be care, comfort, energy, mobility, media, safety, etc. Personalisation and contextualisation of future services for the realisation of the ‘intuitive home environment’ is a key research focus. As such the HomeLab offers a unique co-innovation space for industry, research groups, non-for-profits and other stakeholders involved in the realisation of future living concepts.
