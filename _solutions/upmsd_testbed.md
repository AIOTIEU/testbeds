description: This testbed deployed in Montegancedo Campus is ready to demonstrate services deployed over fleet of drones (demos are carried out with >3 drones). The key asset is the software platform that controls the fleet service lifecycle, from mission configuration to real-time data visualization and sensor-based anomaly detection. Drones are governed as IoT sensing platforms, equipped with in-flight sensors, environmental sensors, and specific cameras (thermal cameras, LiDAR, etc.), mounted in depending on the use case. Different service scenarios have been deployed over the platform, e.g., infrastructure monitoring (e.g., for telecom towers), emergency response (for onsite fast evaluation of an emergency and first-aid kit delivery) and security applications (capacity control in bounded areas). Real-time artificial vision algorithms on-board and on the edge are used to monitor the service. Monitoring tools include specific applications for mobile devices, but also interactive solutions for command-and-control centers.
