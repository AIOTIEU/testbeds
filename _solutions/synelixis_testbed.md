description: SynField, is a Cloud based smart precision agriculture and smart/remote irrigation platform, aggregating weather, leaf and soil information in vineyards, orange, olives, coffee, and tea fields. Currently small networks of SynField are installed in more than 150 vineyards and 30 olive trees in Greece, Italy, Spain, Germany, Denmark, and Finland and in 10 coffee and tea plantations in south India. In details, SynField system targets small-medium sized farms, while it offers the following three main services. SynAir is a versatile sensor platform that accommodates a multitude of Air Quality sensors. The SynAir device, cannot operate by itself, and thus it should be connected to a SynField device, to read and forward the sensorsâ€™ data to the SynField portal. Currently, three basic SynAir versions are available, i.e., SynAir CO2, SynAir City, SynAir City+, supporting the detection of features such as temperature, relative humidity, CO2, Particulate Matter, VOC, NO2, CO, among others.
