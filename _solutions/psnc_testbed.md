description: PSNC FutureLabs are the living labs in education, eHealth, smart City (https://futurelabs.psnc.pl/en/projekty/). Each of the labs provides different kinds of technologies, etc. PIONIER-LAB (https://pionier-lab.pionier.net.pl/laby/) - is one the largest Polish Research Infrastructure roadmap project, in which one of the laboratories is Smart Campus as Smart City. It creates the testbed of 12 smart campuses in Poland, with many  sensors and infrastructure around smart spaces, parking, monitoring, energy, and others. The testbed will be available through the IoT/edge platforms for experimentation. eDWIN (https://www.edwin.gov.pl/) is a national platform for integrated plant protection, and provides access to network of agrometeo stations
concept: Access to data from distributed network of sensors, access to living lab building and spaces, access to data from network of agrometeo stations
technology: IoT, Edge computing, HPC, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Big Data, Cloud Computing, AI, Edge Computing, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality
hardware: Sensor infrastructure; automatic air quality testing stations; Agrometeo stations; smart metering monitoring equipment; robotics platforms and arms; cameras. 42 camera motion capture kit, Grass valley rio kit, pablo neo panel, sony bvm-x300 OLED monitors, phabrix rx500 analyzer (rasterizer), 24-speaker ambisonic installation, scanners (e.g., Arri Scan)
