description: The VERSES Testbed is set to demonstrate the Hyper Spatial Modelling Language (HSML) and Hyperspace Transaction Protocol (HSTP) using COSM (Spatial Operating system) that enables interoperable, semantically compatible connections between connected software and hardware and includes specifications for: 1) a spatial range query format and response language for requesting data about objects within a dimensional range (spatial, temperature, pressure, motion) and their content; 2) a semantic data ontology schema for describing objects, relations, and actions in a standardized way; 3) a verifiable credentialing and certification method for permissioned create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) access to devices, locations, users, and data; and 4) a human and machine-readable contracting language that enables the expression and automated execution of legal, financial and physical activities.
concept: Standard for Spatial Web Protocol, Architecture and Governance
technology: COSM (Context-aware Spatial Operating System) Hyper Spatial Modelling Language (HSML), Hyperspace Transaction Protocol (HSTP)
hardware: Autonomous drones, sensors, smart devices, and robots
software: Various software (services, platforms, applications, artificial intelligence systems)
