description: Tactical Edge environments are those such as disaster scenarios or battlefields in which professionals (e.g., emergency first-responders, firemen or soldiers) usually have limited computing and communication resources, while having to deal with situations that evolve rapidly and unpredictably and high level of stress and need for risk control. The more and more, professionals are equipped with wearable IoT systems, both for self-control, situation assessment and information retrieval. There is a need for virtualizing resources and embedded them in specific tactical architectures that cannot be configured as a standard-cloud centralized service, but on edge and in a distributed manner. In this demonstration, hierarchical data processing for a defense use case, where the soldier wears a smart helmet connected to a tactical cloud architecture, that enables to receive data from external sensors (embedded in drone platforms, vehicles, etc.) in a communications environment that is continuously modified. A prototype of the installation is built for the European Defense Agency, but multiple applications for Law Enforcement Agencies and other partners are feasible.
