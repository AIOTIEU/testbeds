description: The w-iLab.t generic wireless testbeds consist out of embedded PCs in a pseudo shielded environment that are equipped with multiple wireless interfaces, including 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth, IoT sensor nodes with 802.15.4 interfaces and user-defined and cognitive radios. It is up to the experimenters to determine which interfaces will be used, and what software/firmware is installed on the embedded PCs and/or sensor nodes.w-iLab.t 1 contains 44 nodes in a 30m x 10m datacenter. w-iLab.t 2 contains 100+ fixed nodes and 16 robots in a 60m x 20m room for high density and mobile experiments.
