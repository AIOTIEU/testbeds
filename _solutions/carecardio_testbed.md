description: CareCardio provides proprietary tech for best in class automated digitalization of medical devices paper printouts. It handles use cases of remote patient care where IoT-enabled devices are not available or the patient doesn't have control over how medical information is provided. It works with all sorts of lighting, phone camera and other user-centric means, with very high degree of fidelity and translates the picture to standard ECG and BP formats. CareCardio is published as a fully functional testbed, with the vision of a larger set of small-scale software solutions that follow a modular approach to solve technological problems and particular use cases in remote-care and point-of-care health-tech ecosystems and is open to all sorts of partnerships.

concept: The app provides digitalization of paper printouts or other photo images of cardiovascular medical devices readings (blood pressure, ECG, etc.) where IoT readings are not available. The data is being stored on a personal cloud account with tokenized permissions. It is currently being extended with other types of medical data readings, as well as a web dashboard that connects by API to any sort of clinician software. The primary concept of CareCardio and its parent suite of tools is to provide modular solutions to particular technology problems in larger partner solutions in the health-tech ecosystem.
technology: Computer Vision, Medical Data Digitalization, Proprietary Algorithm
hardware: handles readings from all commercial ECG (cardiovascular health) and blood pressure devices
software: Android, iOS
