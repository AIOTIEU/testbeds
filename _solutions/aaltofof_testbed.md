description: The Aalto Factory of the Future 1 is a facility for innovation and education of future industrial automation, industry 4.0 and beyond. It is a space shared by humans, robots, and production stations, which serves as a platform for projects in advanced information technologies applied to future production systems. It focuses on achieving revolutionary high flexibility by exploiting the architecture of modular autonomous intelligent production units. We have access to enabling technologies for production systems that include AI, IIoT, wireless (5G, Wi-Fi 6, LoraWAN) connected to Aalto 5G Test Network, edge/fog/cloud computing paradigms, VR/AR
concept: Distributed automation system in hyper flexible production system based on modular production units
technology: IT/OT integration ranging from IEC 61131-3, IEC 61499, OPC UA, 5G, WiFi6, TSN, LoRA, Digital twin, Edge / Cloud computing, smart wearables, mobile AGVs, HPC, 5G, Wi-Fi 6, LoraWAN, Edge computing.
hardware: Festo Didactic (Festo CP Lab, Festo Modular Production System), AGVs with industrial robots mounted (Mobile Industrial Robot MIR100, UR3, ABB Yumi, Festo Robotino, Milvus Robotics SEIT100), HTC Vive VR, Artec 3D Scanner, vertical farming demonstrator, Schneider Electric PLC, Raspberry Pi RevPi Kunbus, Nokia AirScale
