description: The IMEC Smart Highway Testbed is a 5G-capable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) testbed deployed at the E313 Highway in Antwerp. It contains 7 Road-side units (RSUs) mounted in the gantries over the highway as well as a number of vehicle-mounted Onboard Units (OBUs). Every RSU and OBU is equipped with radios for communication via the ITS-G5 and C-V2X V2X-standards. In addition they are each also equipped with a powerful local 'compute unit' and an SDR (USRP N310 in the RSUs, B210 in the OBUs). These not only enabled 5G-capabilities in the testbed but also enable experimentation with edge computing use cases and with new and upcoming communication standards. The testbed is also equipped with high-precision GNSS receivers (accurate to within 1cm, 5ns). These not only support the various V2X use cases but also serve as a useful baseline in the development of new localization technologies.
