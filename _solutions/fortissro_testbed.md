description: The fortiss Robotics lab is focused on research and innovation on robot-based automation solutions and collaboration with interested stakeholders. It aims at addressing real-world problems and transferring the latest academic achievements into industrially relevant demonstration platforms and use cases. The implemented showcases are used to evaluate, validate, and disseminate research results to a broad audience ranging from industrial partners and other academic institutions to interested students. They further act as an open platform for discussions and joint developments on applied research. The focus is on robotic systems engineering, in particular the intuitive instruction of robot work cells, the semantic interoperability of manufacturing resources for knowledge-based autonomous production, as well as model-based software development for robotics. Within the fortiss Robotics Lab, experiments are conducted that serve to validate theoretical research results.
concept: Development of ontology-based semantic description languages for formal representation of automation knowledge, automatic reasoning components for interpreting semantic models, semantic digital twins of manufacturing resources, novel approaches to intuitive robot programming and work cell (re)configuration; autonomous manufacturing execution systems.
technology: RDF, RDF-S, OWL, OWL reasoners, SPARQL, SHACL, ROS, OPC UA, UA node set information modeling, graph databases.
hardware: Universal Robots UR5s, Kuka LBR iiwas, various vacuum and 2-finger parallel grippers, tool changers, automatic spindle system, F/T sensors, 2d/3d cameras, robot-mounted RGB projectors, 3D printers for rapid prototyping.
software: Neurorobotics Platform, Gazebo Simulator, ROS, Nengo
