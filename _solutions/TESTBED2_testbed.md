description: The increased computational complexity of decision making in extensive smart grid networks and limited performance due to unoptimized large-scale implementations of smart grids have lead to an urgent call-to-action; The combination of interdisciplinary wisdom has lead to the evolution of decarbonized power, heat and transport systems and especially optimization in large smart grid networks. The combination of IoT solutions, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technology have lead to the development of a more robust, reliable, efficient and secure network, which 
benefits users and utilities companies alike. data remotely has made maintenance and repairing tasks an ease, as there is no longer a necessity to waste specialists time on localizing the source of the issue. Additionally, IoT has offered consumers live access to their consumption data, thus facilitating the payment of bills. Blockchain together with cryptography has made significant improvements to the underlying security of the network, by firstly ensuring the authenticity of the information circulated between network nodes and secondly by scrambling the data, in order to prevent potential malicious users from finding out essential information regarding the consumerâ€™s energy usage habits. Artificial Intelligence aims at optimizing the information flow and integrating supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) into the network, thus providing interoperability with existing grid architecture.
