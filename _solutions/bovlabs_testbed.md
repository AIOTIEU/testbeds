description: The Bovlabs PoC is set to demonstrate Ethereum Blockchain. Proof of Authority Based Consensus; 3 million transactions recorded in the first project; 450 transactions per second are supported; Smart agents uses light nodes to transact energy transactions; Smart contracts used for trade and execution (written using Solidity); ERC 20 Tokens used for transacting energy peer to peer. 
concept: Bovlabs provides a platform to manage and control EV chargers. Our goal is to maximize utility for operators and EV owners. In doing so, charging cycles are optimized based on energy price, demand chargers, demand response programmers, along with driver inputs (for example, parking duration). Bovlabs developed an innovative system for SNCF G&C responsible for the management of EV charging stations at passenger train stations. This was done in collaboration with our partners - Nissan, Accenture, the Camp and VINCI Energies - specifically including V2G capabilities. The results were significant - bring more cost effective and optimized - giving rise to greener and more attractive EV charging services.
technology: Ethereum Blockchain; Proof of Authority Based Consensus; Microservices Architecture; Using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud; Java, Python, Nodejs; MySQL; REST; ML; OCPP 1.6; Web apps.
hardware: Bovlabs Smart Agent - Our smart agents integrate with any DERs (like solar, battery storage, EVSE) to record secure P2P energy transactions within the blockchain node embedded within the agent. This creates a distributed, decentralized dataset and with distributed intelligence at edges (ML) creates Virtual Power Plants.
software: Our solution helps to build a sustainable EV charging station by reducing its OPEX by 20-30%. We integrate with EV charging stations and optimize cost through smart charging and P2P energy trading. Our algorithm uses Peak/Off peak Demand, Energy Prices, Parking utilizations, Renewable energy integration, Grid events (TSO/DSO) and creates a unique charging profile.
