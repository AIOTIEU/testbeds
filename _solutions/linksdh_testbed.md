description: The AIOTI DLT 1.10 LINKS DIGITAL HANDSHAKE Testbed is set to demonstrate a blockchain platform aiming at helping gig economy workers to conduct business transactions with untrusted parties by leveraging smart contracts and dispute resolution mechanisms. The solution exploits the intrinsic benefits of DLTs to guarantee a verifiable process with automated payment and fair dispute resolution. The dispute resolution mechanism leverages a custom token and a decentralized escrow service to guarantee a fair and fast completion of the business transaction. The prototype is built on top of the EOSIO blockchain platform.
concept: A blockchain-based solution for making digital handshakes guaranteeing transparency on identity, code, and payments. Building a new form of trust in the digital handshake process (from platform to code) through an EOSIO blockchain-based solution. Fair and decentralized dispute resolution with a pseudo-random selection of jurors for reducing the cost-benefit ratio. Automatic token payments through a decentralized and bulletproof escrow service.
technology: Smart contracts, tokenization, DLT-based dispute resolution.
