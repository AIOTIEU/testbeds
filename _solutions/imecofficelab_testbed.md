description: In the office location, several floors of the building are transformed into a real-life office lab. Wireless and wired sensor technology is deployed, and is open for research on tomorrow’s smart office applications for optimizing work spaces, visitor’s experiences, workers’ comfort, etc. The involved floors are equipped with 40 Intel NUC nodes, supporting several WiFi and sensor technologies. This offers an overall, mutlifloor testbed for distributed intelligence over 150+ nodes in real Office environment. Next to this the OfficeLab offers a unique real life experimental environment for development and testing of smart services based on IoT sensors and actuators. Specific interest of the IDLab research team goes to the use of social robots that are aware of the actual context and their environment based on continuous interaction with the surrounding IoT infrastructure.
