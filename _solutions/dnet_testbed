description: The objective of the testbed was to deploy and validate a platform for integrated poultry farm management with the focus on preserving the wellbeing of the chickens and establishment of a transparent agri-food supply chain. A set of IoT devices is installed on two poultry farms in Serbia to collect relevant data (environmental conditions, machine operational status, chicken behavior) that is processed using ML/AI based algorithms to generate advices and recommended actions to optimize the growing conditions, enable early stress detection and improve farm operations.  The main benefits for the farmers stem from the comprehensive and continuous insights into the production process that lead to improving animal welfare, production optimization and better product quality.
