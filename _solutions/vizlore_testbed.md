description: The Blockchain-Assisted Real-time Transaction Execution and Repository framework (BARTER) Testbed is set to demonstrate a blockchain framework built on top of Hyperledger Fabric, Dash and VizLore's ChainRider service. It is a micro-payment enabler service that can be exploited to support a range of use-cases that need a secure and scalable M2M micro-payment solution, specifically designed for the IoT. Another part of the VizLore DLT Lab is the FT-CHAIN testbed. This testbed is built by Freie University of Berlin and VizLore Labs Foundation in a bilateral research project – set to demonstrate quality and safety tracking of food through complex food supply chains combining federated learning, DLT and IoT.
concept: BARTER is a decentralized private blockchain infrastructure with deployed smart contracts for automated micro-payments and data storage, allowing autonomous interaction between IoT ecosystem entities in carrying out everyday business workflows. Regulations, ethics, and business rules can be incorporated through smart contracts, which are stored on BARTER’s Hyperledger blockchain and provide REST API interface for integration with IoT devices in a secure manner. FT-Chain combines IoT system for food quality measurements (spectrometry methods), IOT system for environmental sensing, Hyperledger Fabric based ledger for trusted data sharing between parties and federated learning framework for high performance data analysis and decision making. The goal is to emulate complex processes and dependencies in food supply chains that might result in food quality degradation and contamination.
