description: The main objective of the project is to apply a holistic approach for decreasing the GHG emissions derived from intensive livestock farming by optimizing the livestock production. For doing this, the consortium will monitor the animal feed, the animal behaviour and characteristics and the stable environment. Specifically, IoT devices will be installed in the farm for monitoring key parameters of: the stable environment (temperature, humidity, gas sensors (NOx, COx, CH4, NH3, etc.), the animal (accelerometer, motion sensor, weight sensor, etc.) and the feed (flow sensor, weight sensor, humidity sensor etc.).
