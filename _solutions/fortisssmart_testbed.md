description: The fortiss Energy Lab, demonstrates research results and challenges related to current and future developments in the field of energy systems. The available demonstrators deal with various application cases and show how real problems can be addressed with findings from science and research and allow them to be presented to a wide audience in an easy-to-understand and vivid way The demonstrators are continuously developed and adapted to current problems. With our lab environment we address existing challenges in the context of research and industrial projects or in the form of student and scientific work. In the fortiss Energy Lab, we work on topics such as the modeling of software systems, into the physical aspects. Here, we investigate opportunities and methods for designing and modeling complex systems as a basis for optimization, monitoring and control, in which the modeling of physical context and prognosis techniques from the area ML/KI are applied. Another focus area deals with evaluating system behaviors and optimizing energy systems. By using our co-simulation environment, hardware in the loop experiments can be conducted and the interactions and control mechanisms of cooperating systems can be analyzed and evaluated.
