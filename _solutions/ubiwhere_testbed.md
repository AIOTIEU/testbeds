description: Ubiwhere’s Nervous System Living Lab is ready to welcome early adopters of 5G technologies to experiment with their solutions in a realistic end-to-end 5G environment. Hardware providers, RAN providers, app developers, students, researchers, startups, scale-ups are all welcome on board to experiment with their solution in this realistic environment. Moreover, the Nervous System Living Lab acts as a platform for every stakeholder to better understand the 5G ecosystem. This initiative’s primary goal is to allow people to make the most of the lab's data. Some actors might want to do data analysis on the network, and others might want to test their solutions in realistic environments or just want to understand the network’s possibilities.
