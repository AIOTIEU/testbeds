description: The AIOTI DLT 1.08 SymbIoTic Flood detection and monitoring Testbed is set to demonstrate how IoT devices can improve the flood detection on the ground, notifying relevant staff over various channels, giving them possibility to see the data in an instant (public IoT data) and inform citizens where they can find other relevant information.
concept: testing IoT devices in the flood test tank and later in the river to define the accuracy and improve it by combining 2 or 3 sensors mutually. Integrating with the existing Disaster Management platform is key, so weâ€™d like to find the partners that are looking to integrate the IoT data into their environment, hence reducing the costs of staff, training, and time, while improving the disaster management processes.
technology: Notifications by many various channels (SMS, email, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Messenger, MS Teams, etc.) we can send a relevant information to whomever interested (there can be a good link with e-wallets/blockchain) Data analytics within IoT platform (event-based thresholds, charts, visualization) / Power BI data analytics / Sending data to other servers and/or platforms by our API or HTTP requests.
hardware: an autonomous IoT device (batteries, PCB) equipped with different sensors (contact and contactless with water).
software: in-house developed software within IoT devices. IoT Platform that aggregates the data and make visualization very quickly.
