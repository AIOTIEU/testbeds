description: The fortissimo Mobility Lab demonstrates how model-based systems engineering (MbSE) concepts can be leveraged to design and implement safe, adaptive, and reliable software and system architectures within a flexible development process. The demonstrator platform includes physical rovers as well as their digital twins. The fortissimo Rovers are based on heavily modified scale 1 to 10 RC cars, equipped with a LIDAR, ultrasound sensors, and an RGB camera. The fortissimo Simulation closely replicates the dynamics and sensor properties of the physical rovers using the Gazebo simulation environment, while providing a standardized interface for their behavior specifications by means of the FMI standard. In both cases, the automotive use case includes advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD) functions. The fortissimo Mobility Lab is unique in its ability to demonstrate the model-based engineering of safety critical cyber-physical systems â€“ from its conception to its verification and validation.
