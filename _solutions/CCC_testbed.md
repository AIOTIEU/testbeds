description: The CCC Testbed series are set to demonstrate practical use cases from the Climate Chain Coalition, a global multi-stakeholder membership of over 270 organizations in over 50 countries (CCC Members). CCC Members use a variety of DLTs (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger, Algorand, Chia, Tezos, Stellar, IOTA, Bitcoin) in combination with other digital technologies. The DLT-enabled digital solutions are deployed for a variety of use case applications (e.g., carbon markets with tokenization and transactions, emissions accounting and MRV, supply chains and product carbon footprints, adaptation to climate impacts, innovative climate finance). Demonstrations and reports with insights into the technical layers allow observers to properly understand how DLT is applied in combination with the IoT and IT stack.
concept: The AIOTI DLT 1.06 CCC Testbeds are CCC Member-driven ‘Use case demonstrators. Each case in the 1.06 Testbed series is dedicated to one CCC Member use case. Approximately 10% of the CCC membership is anticipated to be involved with a demonstration. Each participating CCC Member will demonstrate its own use case(s), and some CCC Members are anticipated to be involved in a second phase to collaborate to demonstrate interoperability of digital solutions across the “carbon value chain and to support a global ‘single market’.
technology: Convergence of IoT, DLT, AI, Digital Twins, and legacy IT components
hardware: On-Premises, Edge and Cloud combined
software: Legacy IT and IoT platforms combined with different DLT protocols.
