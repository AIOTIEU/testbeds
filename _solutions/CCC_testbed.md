Concept: The AIOTI DLT 1.06 CCC Testbeds are CCC Member-driven ‘Use case demonstrators. Each case in the 1.06 Testbed series is dedicated to one CCC Member use case. Approximately 10% of the CCC membership is anticipated to be involved with a demonstration. Each participating CCC Member will demonstrate its own use case(s), and some CCC Members are anticipated to be involved in a second phase to collaborate to demonstrate interoperability of digital solutions across the “carbon value chain” and to support a global ‘single market’
Technologies: Convergence of IoT, DLT, AI, Digital Twins, and legacy IT components
