description: The CCC Testbed series are set to demonstrate practical use cases from the Climate Chain Coalition, a global multi-stakeholder membership of over 270 organizations in over 50 countries (CCC Members). CCC Members use a variety of DLTs (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger, Algorand, Chia, Tezos, Stellar, IOTA, Bitcoin) in combination with other digital technologies. The DLT-enabled digital solutions are deployed for a variety of use case applications (e.g., carbon markets with tokenization and transactions, emissions accounting and MRV, supply chains and product carbon footprints, adaptation to climate impacts, innovative climate finance). Demonstrations and reports with insights into the technical layers allow observers to properly understand how DLT is applied in combination with the IoT and IT stack.
technology: Convergence of IoT, DLT, AI, Digital Twins, and legacy IT components
