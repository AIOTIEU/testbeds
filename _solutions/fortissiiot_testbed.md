description: The IIoT Lab has as motivation to be an experimental and training interoperable and open playground for fortiss, and for partners (academia and industry). Focusing on multi-domain IIoT experimentation, the lab is organized into four main areas of experimentation and technological innovation, IIoT infrastructure simulations and digital twinning; Edge AI; advanced Pubsub communications for IIoT; flexible mobile Edge-Cloud continuum. Across each area, several open demonstrators are available to industrial and academic partners.

concept: Open, interoperable multi-domain experimentation lab for next generation IIoT applications and systems. OT-IT interoperability aspects; automated data matching between IoT sources and IoT services; industrial networks based on wired/TSN and Wi-Fi 6 (scheduling and time synchronization); dynamic container orchestration (based on ML); Information-centric networking applied to different domains.
technology: Wi-Fi 6/Wi-Fi7; TSN/Ethernet; Web of Things/OWL/semantic technologies; IoT communication protocols and architectures, e.g., OPC UA, MQTT, AMQP, ICN; Kubernetes.
hardware: IoT IP-enabled devices, e.g., sensors, Raspberry Pis with sensors, Beaglebones, etc.; Festo stations; Mobile robots such as Turtlebots; Wi-Fi 6 enabled APs (Intel NUC AX200/201; Xiaomi AR 3600, UP Core) and stations; TSN switches; end-user devices, e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops; cameras.
software: Specific open-source software developed by fortiss for each use-case; TSN Linux; MQTT, DDS; Named data networking; Pytorch; Kubernetes/Docker.
