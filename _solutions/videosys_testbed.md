description: APICUS demonstrator platform includes physical anthropomorphic robot equipped with a set of machine vision systems dedicated to quality control tasks. The demonstrator uses machine vision technologies powered by deep-learning engine to quality control task of components manipulated by the robot. The pilot demonstrates integration of edge and cloud technologies that uses IIoT to share information for complex Agile manufacturing scenarios simulation. The station is connected to Cloud-based AI learning system based on Docker technology and NVidia GPUs accelerations. Different pilots are ready to test on various manufacturing sectors (Hollow Glass, high precision mechanical, foundry, furniture, field of household appliances, automotive.
