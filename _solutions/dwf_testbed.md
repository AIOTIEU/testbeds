description:
concept: Large-scale homes retrofit funding includes tokenization of real estate, comfort and health monitoring and related smart contracting. “Increase social cohesion through increased social participatory exchange”: Neighbors are encouraged to share their needs and/or offers (products, services etc.) to help each other out, engage low-income people to participate through ‘earning value’ for the service they offer (valorized / non-valorized). Several aims: increase social interaction through helping, increase resource use (=reducing consumption) through lending/sharing.
technology: Converged IoT and DLT, tokenization, micropayments, smart contracting
hardware: Solar cell, heat pump, ventilation system, air quality sensor, health sensor, cloud storage, virtualization
