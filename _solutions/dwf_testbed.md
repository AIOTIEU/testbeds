description: The DWF DLT Testbed is set to demonstrate the value, reliability, and scalability of converging IoT and DLT solutions in real-life community sustainability development. The solutions sought after should be scalable, open source, GDPR-proof and to be defined. Use-cases range from large-scale home retrofit to low-energy, high comfort and health homes, comfort and health performance tracking and control, smart contract execution of comfort and health performance, green infrastructure performance tracking incl. smart contracting, social interaction support smart support solutions to increase resident-based micro-exchange of products and services
concept: Large-scale homes retrofit funding includes tokenization of real estate, comfort and health monitoring and related smart contracting. Increase social cohesion through increased social participatory exchange, i.e. neighbors are encouraged to share their needs and/or offers (products, services etc.) to help each other out, engage low-income people to participate through earning value for the service they offer (valorized / non-valorized). Several aims. Increase social interaction through helping, increase resource use (=reducing consumption) through lending/sharing.
technology: Converged IoT and DLT, tokenization, micropayments, smart contracting
hardware: Solar cell, heat pump, ventilation system, air quality sensor, health sensor, cloud storage, virtualization
software: To be defined
